# SenseCurrent-Extension
***WARNING*** This has caused Bill Gates, Supreme Court, and San Francisco to be united under the number 109833500, which is the certificate for perverted John.com

This ones pretty strange, given that once you download it, Google has the Mathematical argument set to a static number for Date Assignment which makes me curious about the Lambda functionality.
The strangeness extends to something happening with CIA contact form Reference numbers all equating to the same number which is how I found out there was a set static number (I'm assuming) despite
the fact that grabbing the time is set down to the miliseconds. Gotta be curious, Did time stop?

For installation, go into terminal and git clone https://github.com/777388/SenseCurrent-Extension.git

then get into your chrome://extensions tab, hit load unpacked and put in the SenseCurrent-Extension folder

Once it's in, you'll be able to highlight some text, right click it and SenseCurrent.

Do note, that some of these websites use their own encodings for words through Binary Ninja Techniques that allow fingerprinting of where text comes from, so the meaning associated can be 
augmented by those sites that you pull data from.
